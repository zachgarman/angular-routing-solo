<p>Born with super-human senses and the power to heal from almost any wound, Wolverine was captured by a secret Canadian organization and given an unbreakable skeleton and claws. Treated like an animal, it took years for him to control himself. Now, he's a premiere member of both the X-Men and the Avengers.</p>
<p>Oh, and whatever you do, don't hit him in the balls.  He'll take it personally.</p>
